    "+ **Content-Based Filtering**: This method uses attributes of the items to model ***similarity of items*** or user's preferences (based on previousely consumed items). In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various ***candidate items*** are compared with items previously rated by the user and the ***best-matching*** (ranked) items are recommended. \n",
    "+ **Collaborative Filtering**: This method ***filters*** items to model interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from other users ***collaboration***. The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.   \n",
    "+ **Hybrid methods**:  Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than pure approaches in some cases. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem."

One advantage of using this approach is that instead of having a high dimensional matrix containing abundant number of missing values we will be dealing with a much smaller matrix in lower-dimensional space.  \n",
    "A reduced presentation could be utilized for either user-based or item-based neighborhood algorithms that are presented in the previous section. There are several advantages with this paradigm. It handles the sparsity of the original matrix better than memory based ones. Also comparing similarity on the resulting matrix is much more scalable especially in dealing with large sparse datasets.  "
